# Interview Questions – Task 01: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## 1. What are missing values and how do you handle them?

### Answer:
Missing values are gaps in the dataset where no data is recorded. They can be handled using deletion (`dropna()`) or imputation (`fillna()`), depending on context.

## 2. How do you treat duplicate records?

### Answer:
By using `.drop_duplicates()` in Pandas or Excel’s “Remove Duplicates” function.

## 3. Difference between dropna() and fillna() in Pandas?

### Answer:
* `dropna()` removes rows/columns with null values.
* `fillna()` replaces nulls with specified values (e.g., mean, median, or forward fill).

## 4. What is outlier treatment and why is it important?

### Answer:
Outlier treatment removes extreme values that skew data analysis. It ensures the model isn’t biased or distorted.

## 5. Explain the process of standardizing data.

### Answer:
Standardizing involves formatting text (e.g., making lowercase), date formats, and column names uniformly.

## 6. How do you handle inconsistent data formats (e.g., date/time)?

### Answer:
By using `pd.to_datetime()` to convert all dates to a standard format.

## 7. What are common data cleaning challenges?

### Answer:
* Inconsistent labels
* Typos in categories
* Null-heavy columns
* Misformatted dates or strings
* Encoding issues

## 8. How can you check data quality?

### Answer:
Using `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.isnull().sum()`, value counts, and type checks (`df.dtypes`).
